2.	Processing the Sentence text
Due to the lack of an exact definition of "Informal Text," I have assumed that it would consist of full sentences with 
proper syntactic structure or certain "sentence fragments."
[A sentence fragment is regarded as a sentence without a verb, but with other grammatical constructs.] 
These may lack proper punctuation, capitalization etc. as often found in email messages. Our goal is to process 
such fragments through gazetteer lookups and regular expression matching, since such text cannot be 
correctly parsed by an NLP parser.

However, examining the received messages, one finds that they may contain keywords/tag-based text, unstructured text, 
full sentences or a combination of all. We found that it is not very simple to classify the genre of a sentence 
without developing a suitable Classifier. 

(For the first release, we may make certain Rule-based decisions, although that may not be very accurate.)
